# SignalTypes

Figuring Signal Types Out --  This sketch was made to help visualize the difference between an analog and digital signal, while also differentiating between continuous and discrete signals. 

Special thanks to Daniel Shiffman, his example on additive waves (https://processing.org/examples/additivewave.html) was an inspiration and great starting point.
